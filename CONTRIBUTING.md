# Contributing to libmodbus-rs

We love pull requests. Here are some basic rules.

## Pull Requests

If you are intending to make a pull request, please make your changes in a branch that originated
from the [`development`](https://github.com/zzeroo/libmodbus-rs/tree/development) branch, not the [`master`](https://github.com/zzeroo/libmodbus-rs/tree/master) branch. Then, make your pull request against the
`development` branch.

## Rustfmt

Please use rustfmt `cargo fmt` before open a pull request.
